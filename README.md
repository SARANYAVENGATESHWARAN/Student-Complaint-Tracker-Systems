MICRO-PRPOJECT-STUDENT-COMPLAINT-TRACKER-SYSTEM

The Student Complaint Tracker System is a web-based application designed to help students submit complaints and track their status in a simple and transparent way. The system provides separate dashboards for Students, Faculty, and Admin, ensuring role-based access and smooth complaint handling.

Students can submit complaints related to academic or campus issues, view their complaint status, and update their profiles. Faculty members can view assigned complaints, update progress, and communicate updates. Admin users manage the complete complaint lifecycle by allocating complaints, monitoring progress, and generating reports.

The application follows a clear complaint workflow: Submit → Allocate → Update → Report. All updates are reflected in real time across dashboards, giving users a clear view of complaint progress. The system also supports downloading reports in PDF and CSV formats, making it useful for record keeping and analysis.

This project is built completely on the frontend without a backend or database. Complaint data is managed using JSON objects and local state, making it lightweight and easy to understand. The project demonstrates core frontend development skills such as component-based design, state management, routing, and data visualization.
